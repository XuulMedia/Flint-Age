## About

Inspired by mods like TerrafirmaCraft, I wanted to create something that fit in better with vanilla minecraft while maintaining the accomplishment and buildup of the more hardcore early game mods. Being for a much older version of MC I also wanted to modernize things a bit and take off a bit of the edge. For this reason I aimed to leave the terrain generation alone where possible to mesh better with the game.
